        <p><i>Hello There!I am Rishit Rai, I live in Noida,UP and I am inc Class 6 . I am a student of Bal Bharati Public School Noida and I am the creator of this website ...I started getting a little bit interest in coding when i was in class 5 as threre was a lockdown cause of Covid-19 virus at that time i was just sitting and thinking that how are these games , apps , social medias ,webistes etc. are made so suddenly then my bestfriend called me and we just talking and i asked him that how these apps , websites etc are made then he told me about coding but at that time i was not having things used in coding so I didn't payedmuch attention to it, and a year later I got all things that are needed in coding than I started making things the first language that I used was "python" , it's a amazing language and I loved programming in that kind of language then T started getting bored with it then I googled another languages and then I got know about HTML , CSS and JAVA SCRIPT and I got interest in building webistes very much.....</i></p>
